Lectrn is a social network that is **free**, **decentralized**, **open**, and **easy to use**.

 * **[Gratis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre):** anyone can use Lectrn at no monetary cost.
 * **[Libre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre):** anyone can use and improve upon Lectrn with little restriction.
 * **Decentralized:** Lectrn is made out of instances hosted by individuals, instead of one big central instance (e.g. Twitter and Facebook) hosted by a corporation. This means that you can choose who to trust with your data, and that the rules are being made by individuals, not corporations.
 * **Open:** anyone can host a Lectrn instance, and anyone can look at Lectrn source code.
 * **Easy to use:** Lectrn maintains a database of it's instances, that helps with user onboarding.

The MVP of Lectrn will be microblogging and an OAuth platform, however we are not against implementing other types of social media into our network: we are interested in chat, blogging, video, livestream, and what have you.

### Status
Lectrn is heavily under construction, and is not usable right now. In the meanwhile, you can keep up with the development on other social networks:
 * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lectrn) 
 * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/lectrn)

### Technical stuff
The reference implementation of Lectrn will be written in Node.js. The database used will be PostgreSQL. 

Lectrn will implement ActivityPub, WebFinger, and OAuth.

More details TBD.
